\section{The Takamaka Language for Smart Contracts}\label{sec:takamaka}

This section gives a short introduction to the Takamaka subset of
Java that we use for writing smart contracts in this paper.
This language has been introduced in~\cite{Spoto19}. A full tutorial
is available online, as part of the documentation of the Hotmoka
blockchain that runs smart contracts written
in Takamaka~\cite{hotmoka_repository}. This section introduces only
the essential notions that are needed to understand the subsequent sections.
